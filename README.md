Corncob 3D
==========

Corncob 3D is a 1992 DOS game by Pie in the Sky Software and published by MVP Software.

The source was originally released in 2001:

but then lost, as internet archive didn't get it and the site went down shortly after.

This code has no licensed attached. Make of that what you will. 

Compilation
===========

It can be compiled with MASM 6.0b after I've made minor changes.
It needs Spontaneous Assembly libraries, I believe. 
I'm currently waiting on those to arrive from eBay.
